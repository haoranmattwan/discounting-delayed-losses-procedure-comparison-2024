# Validating Measurement Procedures for Intertemporal Choice

This repository contains the full analysis and replication code for the peer-reviewed publication:

## Project Objective

This project provides a methodological validation of two procedures used to measure human decision-making: the **Adjusting-Amount (Adj-Amt) task** and the **Delayed Losses Questionnaire (DLQ)**. The central research question is whether these two instruments assess the same underlying construct.

The analysis evaluates the **convergent validity**, **concurrent validity**, and **internal reliability** of both procedures. This work is critical for researchers aiming to select appropriate measurement tools that balance efficiency and psychometric robustness, a common challenge in large-scale quantitative studies.

The data are publicly available on the Open Science Framework at <https://osf.io/emb2q/>.

## Methodological Core

This project demonstrates expertise in the following quantitative methods:

* **Individual-Level Parameter Estimation**: Custom functions were developed to process raw trial data from each participant and derive key discounting metrics. This includes an atheoretical measure (Area under the Curve) and a theoretical parameter (the hyperbolic discounting rate, *k*), estimated via non-linear least squares.
* **Psychometric Evaluation**: A comprehensive suite of correlational analyses was conducted to formally assess the measurement properties of the instruments, including:
    * **Alternate-Forms Reliability**: Correlations between different monetary amounts *within* each procedure.
    * **Concurrent Validity**: Correlations between the atheoretical and theoretical measures *within* each procedure.
    * **Convergent Validity**: The primary analysis, correlating scores *between* the two procedures.
* **Analysis of Response Pattern Consistency**: Participants were qualitatively classified based on their choice behavior (e.g., "Typical", "Always Immediate"). Contingency table analysis and a Chi-Squared test were used to determine if individuals exhibited consistent response styles across both measurement tools.
* **Group-Level Model Fitting**: Non-linear (hyperboloid) and logistic models were fit to aggregate data to verify data quality and replicate established patterns in the literature, providing a baseline for the individual-level analyses.
